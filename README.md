#### Data Source

- **Source:** National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
- **Years:** 1999-2017

### Questions Explored

1. **What are the causes of death in this dataset?**

   The dataset includes information on various causes of death categorized by specific conditions and diseases.

2. **What is the total number of deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017?**

   The total number of deaths across all causes and years in the dataset.

3. **What is the trend of number of deaths per year?**

   An analysis of how the number of deaths varies annually from 1999 to 2017.

4. **Which are the 10 states that have the highest number of deaths in all years?**

   Identification of the states with the highest cumulative number of deaths across the entire dataset.

5. **What are the top causes of deaths in the United States?**

   Identification and analysis of the leading causes of death based on the dataset.

### Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Load the dataset using `pandas`.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values or inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
   - Compute summary statistics and visualize distributions.

3. **Answering Specific Questions:**
   - Utilize `pandas` and `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization.
   - Calculate total deaths, trends, state rankings, and top causes based on the data.

### Results

#### Summary of Findings:

- **Causes of Death:** The dataset covers a range of causes including Alzheimer's disease,
       Stroke, CLRD, Diabetes, Heart disease,
 'Suicide', 'Cancer', 'Kidney disease' etc.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the leading causes of death in the USA over a 17-year period. Understanding these trends and patterns can inform public health policies and interventions aimed at reducing mortality rates associated with these causes.

### Usage

- **Dependencies:** Ensure `pandas` (version 2.2.2) and `matplotlib` (version 3.9.0) are installed.
- **Execution:** Run the provided Python scripts to reproduce the analysis and visualize the results.

### Future Work

- Perform deeper demographic analysis (age, gender) on causes of death.
- Explore correlations between socio-economic factors and mortality rates.
- Incorporate more recent data if available to extend the analysis.
